By [Bob Starr](http://www.rtzaudio.com).

## Description
This code drives an ATmega88 coprocessor on the STC-1200 board and is dedicated as a 
7-segment display multiplexor. This coprocessor drives the multiplexed tape position
display on the machine at 500 Hz rate. The display data is sent via UART from the main
Tiva system controller processor on the search/timer/cue card.
